### Project Description
**PlacementIQ** is an AI-powered, browser-based career readiness platform that evaluates students across domain knowledge, aptitude, academics, and experience through 45+ curated questions across Technical, Engineering, and Management tracks. It delivers an instant, personalized placement readiness report with actionable recommendations — helping students identify skill gaps and walk into placements with confidence.

### The Problem statement
Every year, thousands of students enter campus placement season underprepared — not because they lack potential, but because they have no clear, objective measure of where they actually stand. Most students rely on gut feeling or peer comparison to gauge their readiness, often discovering critical skill gaps only after failing interviews. Existing solutions are either too generic, paywalled, or require institutional access, leaving the majority of students without a reliable self-assessment tool. There is no unified, accessible platform that evaluates a student's domain knowledge, aptitude, academic profile, and experience together — and translates that into honest, actionable feedback before it's too late.

### The Solution
PlacementIQ gives students instant, objective clarity on their placement readiness through a structured assessment covering domain knowledge, aptitude, academics, and experience — delivering a scored report with a clear readiness tier and actionable recommendations, completely free and browser-based.

It also connects colleges and recruiters into the loop. Placement cells get batch-wide analytics to intervene early, while recruiters get a lightweight pre-screening signal to surface prepared candidates faster.

**Students get direction. Colleges get intelligence. Recruiters get better talent.**

## Features

List the key features of your project:
- Feature 1: Domain-Specific Assessment: Students choose from Technical, Core Engineering, or Management tracks — each with a curated question bank of 15+ domain questions and 10 aptitude questions, randomly shuffled every attempt to ensure a fresh experience.
- Feature 2: Smart Scoring Engine: Results are computed across four parameters — domain accuracy, aptitude performance, CGPA, and work experience — producing a weighted readiness score, a clear tier (Placement Ready / Developing / Needs Work), and personalized improvement recommendations.
- Feature 3: Live Timed Assessment: A 15-minute countdown with a visual ring timer, question navigation palette, answered/unanswered tracking, and a confirmation-gated exit button — replicating the pressure and structure of a real placement test.
- Feature 4: College-Student-Recruiter Ecosystem: Designed to scale beyond individual use — placement cells can track batch-wide readiness and intervene early, while recruiters can use scores as a pre-screening signal to identify job-ready candidates faster.

**System Architecture:**

![Architecture Diagram](placementiq_architecture.png)
*PlacementIQ is a zero-dependency, single-file web app where all logic runs entirely in the browser. A central JavaScript state object manages data across all five views — Landing, Details Form, Career Selection, Assessment, and Results. The scoring engine combines domain accuracy, aptitude, CGPA, and experience into a weighted readiness score, rendered instantly with no server calls required.*

**Application Workflow:**

![Workflow](placementiq_flowchart.png)
The user begins by entering their academic profile, which is validated before proceeding. They then select a career domain — Technical, Core Engineering, or Management — which filters and shuffles the question bank. A 15-minute timed assessment follows, after which the scoring engine processes all inputs and delivers a personalized readiness report with actionable recommendations.

The image shows a PlacementIQ landing page — a dark-themed, AI-powered skill assessment platform. The hero section features bold typography with the headline "Know Your Placement Readiness", where "Placement" is highlighted in gold/yellow.
On the right side, there's a Sample Skills Profile card displaying a breakdown of scores across five categories — Technical (78%), Aptitude (65%), Domain (82%), Problem Solving (55%), and Communication (70%) — shown as gradient progress bars, with an Overall Readiness score of 72%.
At the bottom, three quick stats highlight the assessment scope: 45+ questions, 3 domains, and ~15 minutes to complete. The overall design is clean, minimal, and professional with a black background, gold accents, and teal/green gradient bar elements.
